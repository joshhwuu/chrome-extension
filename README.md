## What it does:
Our Google extension utilizes several modern APIs and an AI automation network to create more easily digestible pieces of writing from online articles and web pages. Clicking the plugin starts the program, which initializes the scraping, parsing, and summarization of raw text in real time using AI. We present two ways that writing can be potentially displayed to better aid in learning, which is a simple summary as well as a list of main ideas. However, within the given time frame, some of our other ideas were not feasible to demonstrate. These may be implemented in the future, including mind maps and flashcards.

## How we built it:
We used JavaScript to build backend logic to handle user inputs, read page URLs, fetch data, and debug. We used HTML and CSS to create the front-end interface, style the application and position/place elements and variables.
